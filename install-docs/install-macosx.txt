Download the newest version of Sage for Mac OS X.  It is imperative that you do NOT download the "-app" version, as this often does not launch the first time and makes installing the GAP packages (see below) a lot more difficult.  Once you have downloaded Sage, open the DMG file and drag the "sage" folder to your applications folder.

The factorization package also needs to be installed inside a particular component of Sage, called GAP.  Here is the package that must be installed: 

https://bitbucket.org/gap-system/numericalsgps/downloads

For this, click Download Repository, unzip the downloaded file, rename the resulting folder to "numericalsgps".  Then, place this folder in the following directory: 

Applications -> sage -> local -> gap -> latest -> pkg

You will also need the NumericalSemigroup file, available at the following webpage: 

https://github.com/coneill-math/numsgps-sage

Some sample code to get started with GAP is also available there.  

This feels like a long process, but thankfully it only has to be done the first time.  Feel free to shoot me an email if you run into any issues getting it running.
